# hello-world

Hi

I was writing something like this before, but in the wrong place, so here I am to write again.
I'm Via, a vet student and no idea about what I am doing right now, but I have to learn about programming, because I want to.
If you see this, can you teach me what should to do?

hahahahaha wish me luck
I'm just follow the guidelines
xixixi
